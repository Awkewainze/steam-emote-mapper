Using Steam emotes to give your friends cancer

## How use?
Follow link above, fairly simple input textarea
Just click on output box to copy to clipboard

Defaulted to use my emotes for each letter, but obviously people have their own set, so enter your own in and save those babies at the bottom of the page with the "Save to cookie" button. Keeping your settings stored in your browser.

You can also manually save the JSON in case you want to use a different browser or computer, just paste the JSON into the textarea and the fields will update accordingly.
